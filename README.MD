# Givens Fire and Forestry Website

**This repository is a work in progress as I continue to enhance my JavaScript skills and explore automated testing with Playwright.** 

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

For some extra side money, I spent the last month designing and configuring a six-page Squarespace website for Givens Fire and Forestry.

*You can check out the website I created [here](https://www.givensfireandforestry.com/).*

The client wasn't super into the tech side, so I took what we discussed in virtual meetings, along with his business plan, and turned it into a fully functional site with a few special touches:

- **Custom CSS**: I added some unique styles to give the site a distinct look.
- **Google Tag Manager**: Injected code for tracking and analytics to keep tabs on site performance.
- **Logo and Graphics**: Designed a logo and a few graphic elements using Canva and Ideogram AI.

## Givens Fire and Forestry Website Tests

ðŸ‘‹ Quick heads up - the test files (`tests/aboutPage.spec.js` and `page/aboutPage.js`) were actually generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet while playing around with Playwright's MCP server. Just a fun experiment to see what AI could do!
